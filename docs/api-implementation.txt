problem : To return first five tweets of user over an API

Pre API implementation:
- All 5 tweets are available in a DB or sth


"Tweet" table fields

- the tweet itself
- time the tweet was created
- date the tweet was created
- username of tweet owner
- id of the tweet

- Endpoints

all GET requests

1)localhost:8000/api/tweet/{username} = > all 5 tweets of the user
2)localhost:8000/api/tweet/{username}/{id} => specific nth tweet

Request body parameters not included since I won't be changing/editing the resource

2) Headers

Authentication? 

Couldn't find any reason to implement auth

3)Response codes
- 200 (found)
- 500  (server error)
- 404 (resource not found)
